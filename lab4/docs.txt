FA:
    It is a finite automata

    bool accept(std::string str)
        -> check if the string is ecxpeted by the Finite Automata
    
    static FA read_from_file(std::string file)
        -> reads the automata from the file creating an FA
        The syntax of the file is:

            fa = initial_state final_states edges.
            initial_state = character ";".
            final_states  = character {character} ";".
            edges = {edge ","} ";".
            edge  = character ":" character character.
            character = "A" | ... | "Z" | 
                        "a" | ... | "z" | 
                        "0" | ... | "9" |
                        "-" | "+" | "_" |.
